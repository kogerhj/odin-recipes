    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>

    <p class="description-content">A super simple chicken and pasta recipe that packs rich and buttery decadence, rounded by complex wine flavor,
        along with hints of bright lemon, and plenty of freshness from the garlic</p>

    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="ingredient-list">
        <li>1 1/4 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>8 Tbsp unsalted butter, diced into 1-Tbsp pieces</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp minced garlic (6 cloves)</li>
        <li>12 oz. thin spaghetti (or standard)</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc</li>
        <li>1/8 - 1/4 tsp Red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped parsley</li>
        <li>2/3 cup shredded parmesan cheese (or Romano cheese, for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="steps-header">Steps</h2>

    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil to cook pasta (cook according to directions on package, to al dente. I
            find it's best to start cooking the pasta in the boiling water when the wine is reducing just before step
            7).
        </li>
        <li>Dab chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Toss with flour, Italian seasoning and salt and pepper (I use
            about 3/4 tsp salt 1/4 tsp pepper).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile melt 3 Tbsp butter with 1 Tbsp olive oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>Add chicken in a single layer and let sear until browned on bottom, about 4 minutes, turn and let cook
            through about 2 - 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>
            Transfer chicken and butter mixture to a bowl or large plate. Tent with foil to keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return pan to medium-low heat. Melt 1 Tbsp butter. Add garlic and saute about 20 seconds, don't brown it.
            (At this point, separately add pasta to boiling water to cook to al dente.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour wine and red pepper flakes into butter garlic mixture in skillet and let simmer until reduced by about
            3/4, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add remaining 4 tbsp butter and let melt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice. Return chicken to skillet and toss with sauce, season with salt and
            pepper as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss drained pasta with chicken, sauce mixture, and parsley. Garnish servings with parmesan and serve warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
