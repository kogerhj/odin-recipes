    <h2>Description</h2>

    <br>

    <p>This is quite possibly my favorite meal. Chile Colorado
        is a Mexican beef stew that uses flavorful red chile sauce
        made from dried mMxican chiles, broth and spices.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 dried ancho chiles , or pasilla or mulato</li>
        <li>5 dried guajillo chiles , or New Mexican chiles</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth , divided</li>
        <li>1 small onion , chopped</li>
        <li>½ of a jalapeno , minced (optional, for more heat)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>2 ½ lbs stew meat , or cubed beef shoulder/butt roast*</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>Juice from 1 small lime</li>
        <li>Cornstarch slurry (1 Tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 Tablespoon water)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove meat from fridge and cut into ½ inch cubes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove the stems (and seeds if you want, for milder heat) from the dried chiles while rinsing them under
            cold water. Place chiles in a saucepan and cover with broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and
            simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the meat. Season on all sides with salt and pepper and sprinkle with flour. Add oil
            to a skillet over medium high heat. Once hot, add meat and cook until browned on both sides. Depending
            on the size of your pan you will need to do this in a few batches to keep from overcrowding.</li>
        <li>Remove meat to a plate and set aside. Add onion and jalapeno to the pan and saute for several minutes
        </li>
        <li>As the onions cook, pour the softened peppers and the broth into a blender. Add the sautéed onion and
            jalapeno and blend until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Return browned beef (and accumulated juices) back to the pot. Strain the chili sauce from the blender
            through a fine mesh strainer, into the pot. Add oregano, cumin, paprika, garlic powder and stir well.
            Add bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Bring to a slow boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about an hour, or until the meat is
            very tender.</li>
        <li>Uncover and stir in lime juice and cornstarch slurry. Cook for a few more minutes, until the sauce has
            slightly thickened.</li>
        <li> Serve as a stew with tortillas for dipping and a side of Mexican rice and beans.

        </li>
    </ol>
